       "'Hi. Todd Maher, eHarmony. How can I help you today? Hi. I cant seem to leave a wink for someone. I dont know, is my page broken? Do I... do I maybe have a broken page or...? Ive never heard of that, but okay. Youre trying to use your eHarmony account for the first time? I am. Okay. Im looking at your profile. We have a pretty intricate matching algorithm. Thats what distinguishes us from other online dating services. Yeah, I like that. Actually, Im just trying to leave a wink for one person. Cheryl Melhoff? She started in my division at work about a month ago, and I overheard her near the bagels saying she was on your site. Okay, thats unique, but let me ask you, you left a lot of this stuff, like... like the \"Been There, Done That\" section, you left it blank. Yeah, I think I skipped it. Okay, well, you got to help me out here, man. Dont skip stuff. Okay, well, I havent really been anywhere... noteworthy or mentionable. Have you... have you done anything noteworthy, mentionable? Hello? You still there? Can you hang on a second? My God! Go, go, go! Get out! Get out! Shes gonna blow! Go! Go! Chips! Over here! Chips! Thank you! Howd you know about the building? I heard barking, thought I smelled gas. I hope its okay. I engineered a prosthesis for Chips while I was sprinting down the stairwell. Little hip-joint assembly with a drop-ring lock and an anterior pelvic band. God, youre noteworthy. I just live by the ABCs. Adventurous, brave, creative. Thats everything I want in a man. My man? Hey, my man, you still there? Hey. What, did you pass out or...? No, I just, like, zoned out for a second. Okay. Do you do that a lot? A normal amount, I guess. Yeah... I... I got to run. Sorry. O-Okay, but we... we need a lot more... Hey, bad day to be late. We just got acquired. What? Yeah, over the weekend. Walter, happy birthday! Hes 42 years old! Odessa, what are you doing here? Mom made you your favorite clementine cake. Arent you supposed to be at the retirement place with her getting the piano moved in? Yes, I was there. Its, like, halfway done. Piano is out of the van, its on the street. Everythings fine, but I just got a phone call about a really big audition, so can you go finish it? No, I cant; Im late. Walter, I... I dont think youre seeing this from what I need. What do you... What do you need? I need to be Rizzo in Grease. I dont understand that. My audition... Rizzo. Rizzo? Rizzo. Shes tough and tender. Do me a favor, please. Make sure Moms piano gets moved in all the way, all right? Dont go to Rizzo. Thanks, Walter. Happy birthday! Guess what. We just got acquired. Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Theres gonna be changes, downsizing of us into some kind of dot-com thing possibly. I wonder how this thing goes down, how the transitions gonna play out. I could probably tell you. Ted Hendricks, managing director of the transition. Hey. Tim Naughton, sales. Gary Mannheim, graphic design. And what do you do, cake man? I... I do the, um... The cakes just for today. Im not a cake man. I do... I-I deal dirctly... \"Dirctly\"? Directly with, LIFEs photo units... Im sorry, I was really getting into this song. I stopped listening to you. I was saying, you know who looks good in a beard? Dumbledore, not you. Guy... Guy? What do you do? Im a negative asset manager. Worth the wait. Ted. Donny. You feeling tough? Feeling good. Well, got to make some tough calls ahead. Youve been here before, yeah? Yeah, so this is it? Yeah, the house of pictures. Hey. Hi. How was your weekend? I... I had an awesome weekend. And what did you do this weekend? Um, lets see. I bathed in Arctic mountain water while my Latin lover recited verse to me. You slut. I know. Actually, I waited for my refrigerator repairman who never came. Im so sorry. Im gonna call you later. Okay. The ice, yes? She moves like a woman. Im Walter. Mitty. Cheryl. Melhoff. Where have you been? Testing the limits of the human spirit. Id like to climb your hair, test that out. Perhaps I can contact you possibly through my poetry falcon. Poetry falcon. I like that. Do you think if I hit him with a paper clip, would he move? Yeah, I dont know. Do it. Hello. I actually threw a toner box at him once. Yeah? Did he move? No, I-I missed. Thats a great story. Ground control to Major Tom. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Wow. Moving on, as they say. Yeah. Conference room, more of these stations here where people sort of do their thing. Layouts here for... Morning, Hernando. Theres a new nut pouch. Did you hear? Yeah. I... met him. Were gonna be evaluated. They wont be able to. We do intricate details back here. Yeah. Its tricky and bewildering. I should evaluate you; you should evaluate me. I dont think theyll let us do that. Just saying. Hey, how long has this neg roll been here, out in the open? Its a Sean OConnell. It came in this morning. Theres a present, too. He sent you a present on your desk. Sean OConnell still shoots on film. That results for me in a man crush. Hey, you want to mount these? Seriously? Sure. Heard rumblings LIFEs done, man. Wanted to say thanks. Take a look inside. A gift for all the years of hard work. Sorry about the neg roll. I spilled some blood on it while self-stitching a gun wound to my abdomen, but number 25 is my best ever. The quintessence of LIFE, I think. I trust youll get it where it needs to go. You always do. Whatd you get? Um, its a wallet. With LIFEs motto on it. Here you go. Wheres 25? Its not there. Hey. We need negative 25. Sean OConnell sent a telegram. An actual telegram. A 100-year-old dude came in a little hat. So theres a floor meeting. Bring 25. It-its here somewhere. Well find it. Okay, make a contact sheet of these frames as soon as you can, and dont say anything to anyone. Yeah. I just wanted to inform you all, reluctantly, that... I guess just start back from the beginning. Okay. I just wanted to inform you all reluctantly that, this months issue will be our last. What? Yeah, what? Thats some bull. Yeah. Sad... news for sure. Now, youre all valued employees, but as we undergo this transition to,  LIFE Online, we wanted to be candid with you that, some of you will be determined non-vital employees to the new... the new partnership, and well be deciding which of those positions will be remaining with us over the course of the next week. Also, we feel sad about that, as you can see. Now, for some good news. We are very excited for... All right, Don. Ted Hendricks, managing director of the transition. Never fun, this stage. But we do have ahead of us the privilege of publishing what will be the very last issue of LIFE magazine. And for the final issue, we just received a telegram... come on... from Sean OConnell, who has never, Im told, been willing to speak with the executives here. Well, he broke his long silence and shared his thoughts with us through that... that old man. Sean OConnell. \"I expect full consideration \"of negative 25 for cover. \"My most grand, the quintessence of LIFE.\" The... what is that? What-what is that? It means, like, the fullest and most rich. Okay. So our cover will probably be the most famous ever because it really will have the big quintessence of all time. Very full and so rich. So lets see this thing? Lets see it. Can we... What do we... What am I doing up here? Whats going on? Well receive it now from Negative Assets. This gentleman here. Negative Assets. Last man in. Whats that? Major Tom. Can I, get that? Its, being processed. All right, well, lets do it. Lets process some quintessence. Come on. Go. Now. Thats why Im clapping. Wait, when do we go to press? Two and a half weeks. Please dont worry. Youre going to be fine, okay? Youve been here forever; Im sure he wont... Dont worry, its gonna be fine. It was nice talking to you. Well, guess Ill talk to you later. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. Im, Walter. Cheryl. Mitty. Melhoff. Yes, You... you work in Photo Accounts, right? I do. Negative Assets. Yes. Im... Yeah. Processing the last cover photo. Thats-thats a big deal. Yeah, its... theres... We have a glitch. Mini on that one right now. I wanted to say to you, do you maybe have an address for Sean OConnell? Um, its not really that easy with him. He moves around so much. I dont. Yeah, hes on a freelance. I dont know where, and he doesnt have a phone. No phone? Hes old-school. Yeah. Well... Um, but, you know, um, why dont I check with Peg? I know she just processed a check for him, and we could track his payout, maybe, find him that way? Cool. Very cool. Okay. Okay. Walter. Yes. All right. All right. Im on it. Okay. Thanks. Yes, okay. Are you coming? Yes, Im not. Yes, I have to stay. Heres the contact sheet. What do you see? This photo cluster, these three, theyre the only printable ones. He took them around the same time he took 25. They could give us a clue to where Sean is. Blow them up, all right? Cool. Hey. Walter, right? Yeah. So I called Peg about Sean. Shes gonna get back to me. Hey, thanks. Cool glasses. Very Sand People. These? These are... No, these are loupes. Theyre for work. They magnify the... Is that 25? Can I see? Thats, no. I cant quite find 25 just now. You cant find it? Yeah, thats why Im trying to find Sean. Im trying to track him down somehow with, these other images. His whereabouts? Yeah. I take this class, Writing the Mystery Novel. Anyway, they say the key is to work backwards. You connect the clues and then scatter them so they seem unrelated. Theres, like, a whole science to it. May I? Sure. Okay. Thumb. Yeah, its a... Its an unknown thumb. Okay. Water? Just water, I guess? Yeah, just water. Okay. And, um... like, a curved piece of... some kind of part of a thing. But, hey, you know, the thing with clues, my teacher says, is you really only need one good one and then theyll connect, and youll be like, \"Yes, of course, unknown thumb, water. I shouldve seen this the whole time.\" Yeah, yeah, Ill be like, like... Well, anyway, I should get back and try not to get fired. Hey, Cheryl? I have something creative Ive been working on, too. A little side project. Walter, its amazing. Walter. I was just saying Ill let you know when I hear back from Peg. Okay. Thank you. Hey, Odessa. What? Is there a larger apartment available the piano could fit in? Cause thats a memento of our moms. Thats a really big... Most people sell their really big mementos before they move here. My dad bought it for her the year they were married, and it means a lot to her. Thats a villa. Its a little more costly, but it has a more generous, piano kind of size living room for you, though. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. On move-in, youd need first months, last months and full deposit. Thats, $4,700. Great. Yeah, okay. Yeah, well take it. Ill get the paperwork. The new villa comes open in three weeks. Im guessing. Okay. Happy birthday. Stretch Armstrong! Stretch Armstrong. Thats cool. Yeah. Isnt that awesome? Wow. This was your favorite thing when we were little. Do you remember? Yeah. You want to do it? Yeah, all right. Come on, Stretch! Good, good! Okay, come on, we got to go. A villa, okay, but hey, Im not the Queen of Sheba. You got to have room for your piano. You can stay at my place until its ready. Well, I wont be cramping your scene. My scene? No. Yeah. And Im sorry we couldnt get you in here today. Walter! Look what I found! Th-This is from you and Tim Linderman. Did you remember, we were gonna backpack Europe? That June Dad died? Man! What is in here? Thats my Walter box, so those are my Walter knickknacks and keepsakes. You made the best mix tapes. Man. What? Whats that? Travel journal Dad gave me. You should donate that... because you never used it... to a poor kid. A poor kid whos going to travel to Europe? What... Look at you and your dad. Is that my tournament one? He was so proud of this. Sharing your accomplishments with the whole world. Its from the Fairview Smalltowner, Mom. Well, I really liked that nifty Mohawk. You know, when your daddy died, and then you went to work in that pizza place, the one that was named after a father... had that father kind of name. Papa Johns. Yeah. Delivery. And I thought perhaps that it-it was really sad for you working in a restaurant named after a father, after your father just died. I never even thought about that. Probably cause I didnt call Dad \"Papa.\" You had a weird style. That wasnt my style. That was a uniform... KFC. My worker bee. Aw. \"Word in the water\"? Okay, you know what? I got to go. Were getting you into a villa situation, okay? Okay. Good, everybody? My worker bee and my performance artist bee. Aw, thank you, Mom. Hernando. Hey. I dont see anything. Upper middle. Its faint. Theres a word in the water. Im getting nervous, Walter. Hey, this is an ocean. Thats a boat. \"Erkigsnek.\" He was near this boat. See you in a few. Ill check the mailroom. Final cover. Big responsibility. Is that my quintessence? This is... No. Were, um... were prepping the wetting agents on that to start the process. Really? Because it looks like youre playing with toys. No, this is... this is a gift. Yeah, um, the negative needs to go through a very technical... Im sorry. I cant have a professional conversation with you. You and your little blond pal. Okay. Lets... You cant walk through the office with him? Lets have it. So Ill put it away. Give me the toy, man. No. Now. Hey! This is a place of business, not a place of jelly-man toys. Get off it! No, Im taking it! You cant just take my stuff. Its mine! Give it to me! No! Stop fiddling with sweets and little men! Im trying to do my job! Are you the Tin Man? Need a little oilcan? Jesus. Picture. Hello? Hey! Hey. Whats up? Um, who is this? Todd, from eHarmony. Hi. Yeah, when I lost you there, I was saying we need to beef your profile up, make it, you know, not blank. Real quick, lets build your \"Been There, Done Thats.\" Um, okay. Been there... um... Phoenix. I forgot why. Then, Nashville, but that was just the airport on the way to Phoenix, so I dont know if that... Well, hey, man, I was thinking, if you work with this girl, why dont you just, you know, humanly invite her out? No, no, no, Im... Im trying to do, like, a \"PiÃ±a Colada Song\" thing. PiÃ±a... \"PiÃ±a Colada Song\"? Yeah, you know, a guy posts an ad looking for a lover, and then his wife answers it, and turns out they were soul mates and didnt even know it, and they end up making love in capes... or on a cape. It-its a song? Can you sing a little bit, just...? Yeah, you know... You know that song? I have to go. Is that Hall & Oates? Hey. Hey. Is that another clue? Yeah. This ones okay. Yeah? Theres a boat there, I think. \"Er... kig...\" \"Snek.\" Erkigsnek? Yeah. Sounds like a real clue. Yeah, its the boats name. Have you Googled it? I was on my way to. Yeah. N-U. Thats the, first two letters of the port city. Buffering. So... the park. I got to run up there and pick up my son. Hes skateboarding with a friend. Do you want to walk up with me? Starting now? Yeah, starting now. Okay. Yeah, we got to figure this out. Its a big deal. You lost a Sean OConnell. Yeah, I used to work at Nabisco. And then I had a... change, and I decided to apply to LIFE. Thought it would be more colorful, less regular, I guess. You know, I just like the idea of it. Um, I like the motto of the company. Do you know it? \"To see the world...\" \"Things dangerous to come to...\" \"Things dangerous to come to...\" Yeah. \"To see behind walls...\" Yeah. Yeah, I, um... I got this from Sean. He gave this to you? Yeah. I like that: \"to draw closer.\" So, whats he like in person? Sean? Yeah. Well, I havent actually met him. I... I mean, we talk a lot, but Ive... Ive been his point guy here ever since I started. How long ago was that? 16 years. 16 years? My gosh. Wow. Well, you have nothing to worry about. With the layoffs, I mean. Ive been here for a month. \"Last in, first out,\" right? Sorry. Its Richs dad. Its your... Um... Former... newly former. But weve been sort of... I dont know. You know, I dont need to get it. So, what kind of skateboard does your son have? Um, I have no idea. Its oblong. I dont know. Why? No, I just, um... I used to... I was kind of into the scene. Like... The skateboard scene? Yeah. Wow. Hi, Peg. Yeah, Sean OConnell. We actually, need to find him. Yes. If you could hurry. Kickflip. Yeah. Its a good one for the repertoire. Im Walter. Rich. Yeah, we think he might know something or have an asset we need. You know, you just got to get a little more snap, get that thing up there. Want me to, show you something? Sure. Here. Like your trucks. Thanks. Check this out. Know about the flick? Yeah, we-we-weve finished processing his April work order. Yes, its kind of important. Okay. Did you forward the job 1090s? Or his last salary? Wow! Okay. Wow. Here you go. That was awesome. So it could be either place. Thanks, Walter. Okay. Thanks, Peg. All right. Hey. So, um... Seans definitely not in New York. Peg said she sent multiples. I dont know if you know how it works with him. She sends copies cause we never know wheres hes going to be. And this week, she sent 1090s to Princeton, New Jersey. Great. Train ride. And one to Greenland. Just in case. Greenland, the country? Thats, um... you cant take a train there. No. Well, maybe hes in Jersey. Yeah. Yeah, is your phone done buffering with that ships name? Um, yes. Look. Here it is. Nuuk, Greenland. Thats... Yeah. Come on, thats a good lead. You should follow that up. Yeah, follow it up in Greenland. Yeah. Why not? Go. Crack the case. Listen to your wallet. Sorry. Its my, um... its Phil again. Um, maybe he fell down a well or something. Maybe I should get it. Hey, buddy. Here. Rich, Rich, Rich! Not so fast. Here, here, here. Take that. Take that. Yeah. I understand. Okay. Bye. He did fall down a well. But I dont care. I just want to be with you, you know? Really? Lets run away together. Lets make every moment count, starting now. Sweet. Can I tell you something? Anything. I have that Benjamin Buttons thing. Where you get old but smaller or whatever and become a gradual old baby or something. I didnt see the movie, so I dont really know how it works. But I have it. We can still build a life together. Cool. I like your snappy little suit. I bought it at a doll store. Cool. My little heart is no bigger than a quarter, but its as full as Fort Knox. Youre the bravest man Ive ever known. I love you, baby. Not like \"baby,\" like, because you look like a little weird baby-man. I get it. Thank you for such a wonderful life. Youre... I... Shh. Just nestle in here and die. Good-bye, Walter. Good-bye, Walter. Bye! Walter! Walter. Walter. Bye. Sorry. I was just... Where do you go? I-I started, thinking about... No, its okay. I was probably boring you about my broken refrigerator. No. Rich! My sons running into the street. I-I have to go. Yeah. I wanted to tell you, um, that song, \"Major Tom,\" back there, when the beard guy was... he doesnt know what hes talking about. That song is about courage and going into the unknown. Its a cool song. Rich! Yo. Wheres my thing? Its in a silver bath. I dont even know what language youre speaking right now. You know, you got to take me seriously. I got a magazine to execute here. And bosses to answer to. So next time I see you, I see that picture. Okay? Hey, dream machine. Hello? I just... I-I want proof you heard me. Next time I see you... You see the picture. Thats right. Any luck, Hernando? I turned the place upside down... 25s not here. I searched Receiving, too, man. This never happens. Im telling you, its nowhere, Walter. I mean, maybe he didnt even send it. Maybe its still on him. Walter? Walter! Hi. Hi. Do you have any cars available? Yeah. We have a blue one and a red one. Ill take the red one. Hi. Hi. Can I ask you... Could-could someone receive mail here? An American? Sean OConnell? I think he might have received mail at this address. You want a drink? Okay, yeah. I guess... A small beer shoe.

Hey, I walked down to say hi to you about an hour ago and you werent there. Thats cause... guess what. Im in Iceland. Iceland? Wait, w-wasnt it Greenland? Yeah, yeah, it was. : You know that theyre not the same place? No, no, no, I-I went to Greenland, and then I got on a fishing vessel tracking Sean, and... and ended up here in Iceland. Youre in Iceland. Yeah, at a Papa Johns. Hey, I got more clues. What-what did you find? Theres a date that Sean wrote and some words on a cake wrapper. \"Rajqawee,\" \"Buzkashi\" and, \"Warlocks.\" Wait, they have a Papa Johns in Iceland? Yeah, I just had to... just left. Did you get kicked out? No, I just needed to leave. Just the atmosphere and the... cups. Hey, I was right on Seans trail. Then I lost him. Strong little man. Thanks. No. Rajqawees means strong little man in, like, 40 Arabic countries. And Buzkashi is goat hockey in Central Asia. And, \"Warlocks...\" Yeah, um, I was hoping they would connect. So you said that you left Papa Johns because of the cups? Is there something I should be aware of as a customer? No, I just, I worked there, thats all. I just... I used to have a Mohawk and, a backpack, and I guess this idea of who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. And... Yeah? Nothing, just... Just, I was pretty close with my dad, and he died when I was 17 on a Tuesday, and we didnt have any savings, so I got a haircut that Thursday, and, a job, the same Thursday. Papa Johns? Yeah. Your dad let you have a Mohawk? He shaved my head. Thats a good dad move. Yeah. Is it nice there? Yeah, it is. Its... Its really beautiful. Well, its pretty sucky here. Human Resources has already started letting some of the staff go, so itll be a lot different when you get back. Hey, I picked something up for... I think I lost you. You know what, Ill catch you up when I see you. Great. Okay, all right. Ill... Okay. Um, okay, bye, Walter. Bye, Cheryl. Whats going on? All the way in. All the way to the back.

Theres no such thing as a \"silver bath.\" Listen, there was uncertainty about the negative. I thought... I understood that, hopefully, it was in Iceland... It was in your care! If you just give me some more time... Youre fired. Well make another cover. Hey! More than a million... way more... negatives have come through my office. I have never mislaid one. Put it on a plaque. Hang it at your next job. Now I got to explain this to the board? Yeah, Im sure Sean OConnell will be thrilled. Hey... Tell me again... who is this guy? You okay? Yeah.

You just let yourself out. Hes good for this. Whatd I tell you? You gonna stay for dinner? Mom, Id love to. I think Im just really wiped out after supervising moving that thing all day. I think I just need to go to yoga and then just crash. What is it? A class? Yeah, its yoga. Its a class. I go to the hot kind, where they heat the room. Have you heard of that? Sure. You have? Its good for you. Its great for you. You just get it all out of your system. You just get all your sweat out, you just get everything, all your fear. Im waiting on a call about an audition, and I just... Ooh, that Grease show? Yeah. Rizzo? Yeah. Im really excited about it. I havent even heard of that. But I just gotta get it... I just... whats good about this is that I just dont worry about it. Just get out of my head. Is that good, too? I feel like its good in a class like this. I mean, Im not going to get paid for it, which is fine. Its not about money. Wonderful. And I feel like, you know, its just for kids, but I think its important for them to start early. Im really thrilled, Mom. You know, I think Im just going to enjoy it. Just standing in front of people and talking. Youll be good at that. Yeah. Youll really be good at that. I think so, too, Mom. Hey, Mom? Yeah. Did somebody take a picture of your piano, like, a week ago? I did. With Seans camera. Sean OConnells camera? Yeah, he came to visit. Mom, what? Yeah. He wanted to know about your work schedule, when you left, when you came home. He said you really understood LIFE. He was really interested in your work. You... Mom, why didnt you tell me? I told you. I told you in the produce aisle. I remember that. Maybe you were... Odessa, what is it you call it when he goes into one of his little places? Zoned out. You do that now and then. Whats the matter? I got fired. I lost a picture of his. Can you find it? No, I dont know where he is. Hes some... someplace with warlocks or... Warlords. No, warlocks. No. Warlords. Sean said he had to meet with warlords very soon, and maybe he would take my cake so that he could get permission to trek through the wilds and places. He said he wants to photograph snow leopards. How about that? Who? \"Ungoverned Afghanistan.\" Thats where Sean is. Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah. In the upper Himalayas. They cant let you go. You were Seans partner. He told me that you were the person who worked the hardest to make sure his work was realized the way he wished. You finish his work. Hey, Todd. Hey, whats up? Not much. Hey, good news. Your profile really rounded out, man. That-that volcano-shark combo. That is money in the bank. Get ready to get a lot of winks. Okay. But, um, something else. Cheryl Melhoff... shes not on here anymore. Withdrawn. Really? Yeah. Hey, man, where are you now? Himalayas. The Himalayas. I love it. Wait a minute... that is a kick-ass \"Been There.\" Todd, Im gonna keep this short. I have to make oxygen choices. Hey, I get it. Go! Anyway, you have a profile now. Congratulations. Cool, but... you know what? Would you take me off? I cant really swing that $500 yearly. Hey. Um... well... Hey, man. Youre sure? Cause I feel like were really onto something here. I mean, this is... Do you mind? Im working. This is one of the best profiles Ive ever done, and... and our refund policy, well, you know, we dont have one... Todd, I gotta go. Sean. Yeah. Its... its Walter. Mitty. Walter Mitty. Seriously? How the hell did you get up here? I just... Ive been looking for you. Sit down. Ill sit. Well, take your time. Settle in. Try to be real still, okay? Theres a snow leopard. Right in this ridge. So we have to try to be very, very, very, very still. They call the snow leopard the \"ghost cat.\" It never lets itself be seen. Ghost cat? Beautiful things dont ask for attention. Sean, there was a... negative that got separated from your roll. Im taking a lot of heat over it at work. It never came with the roll that you sent. The last roll youre talking about? Yeah. The 25. Yeah. Youre sitting on it. Why am I sitting on it? Its in your wallet. That was the gift. The photograph. The wallet was just something I could put it in. So I put it in a little slot, the little picture holder in there. I thought itd be cute. I told you, \"Look inside.\" In the note. You said, \"Look inside.\" I thought you meant, I thought you meant look inside of the wrapping paper. Yeah? Well, you got a real nice surprise coming. No, I dont have it. I dont have it anymore. Whoa. What the hell were you thinking? I mean, I-Im sorry, Ive admired you for a very long time, but that is not a good move, at all, with a valuable negative. Sorry, I just... I-I thought it would be a playful kind of thing. Playful? Too playful. I see what youre saying. With the cover, I should have been more straightforward. But can I ask you? I mean, if you dont mind... what did you do with the wallet? Chucked it. Well, that hurts my feelings. No... man, I liked it very much. I appreciated it very much. So you threw it away? I... So you have no idea what it was. The photograph. Its a shame. It was a beauty. Howd you find me, anyway? My mom. Cool lady. Knows how to bake. Yeah. Hey, why did you...? Shh. When are you gonna take it? Sometimes I dont. If I like a moment... I mean, me, personally... I dont like to have the distraction of the camera. I just want to stay... in it. Stay in it? Yeah, right there. Right here. Now its gone. Its gone. That looks like fun. I think Im gonna jump in. Hey, what-what was the picture, Sean? Were going to be odd-numbered if you dont join. What was the picture? Lets just call it a ghost cat, Walter Mitty. You made the watch list. Howd you get to Afghanistan? Theres a travel ban. Through Yemen. Violent place. Thats why the air fares only $84. Can I have my fife back? Do you know anyone in Los Angeles? No. Any acquaintances? Okay. Any companions? Anybody here who might be able to verify that youre Walter Mitty? Walter Mitty? Yeah. Todd Maher, eHarmony. Hey. Thank you. Thanks. I really... What? Come here, come here. Backpack. Big hug! Airport prison? Yeah. Yeah? Tell me all about it over a Cinnabon. Come on, Cinnabon. How long were you detained for, by the way? Like, 17 hours. Wow. Hows that Cinnabon taste? Really great. Thats like... Thats frosted heroin. Thats what youre eating. My friend, thats what youre having right there, man. Its good. By the way, you got 300 winks before I took down your profile. Three... in, like, the space of two hours. It was crazy. I thought I was selling concert tickets. I never checked. Because of the, the-the piÃ±a colada girl that quit? Yeah. Yeah, Cheryl. Cheryl, who... did not respond to a single wink the whole time she was on there. Thats a choosy lady. Hows the, daydreaming going? Lately, less. Good. Less is good. Thanks for the pastry. Yeah, well, you owe me. Ill send you a check as soon as I sell the piano. You have a lot on your plate. What are you gonna do now? Go out and get another job. Boom. Im sorry, Walter, I just... What? You are so not how I pictured you. What-what? How-how did you picture me? I pictured you as a little gray piece of paper, but now I see you and its like Indiana Jones decided to become the lead singer of the Strokes or something like that. Its nuts, I know. Sorry, Mom. What for? Dad bought it for you. It was my responsibility. Walter. Were all grown here. Were all good. Ooh, thats heavy-duty, that sum. You should put this in your wallet. I dont have one. Found it in the trash. I always save your knickknacks. Thanks. Got it, Mom? Got it. Watch the stairs. I think this works. Heart of America, different generations, this says it all. Hey, welcome. Wait, Im sorry, not welcome, not an employee. Sorry. Theres the picture Sean wanted... 25. You have two days to print for cover. Theres your quintessence. Hey. Do you know our motto? LIFE. Im lovin it. Thats... no. Thats-thats McDonalds. This thing that you do, Ted, where you come into a place and you push people out... you should know that those people worked really hard to build this magazine. They believed in the motto. And I get it, you got your marching orders, and you have to do what you have to do, but you dont have to be such a dick. Put that on a plaque and hang it at your next job. What was it? Sasquatch? A unicorn? The negative? Yeah. I didnt look. You were a good boss, Walter. Thanks, man. Thanks. Hey, Walter, whats up? Check this out. See you! Hi. Walter Mitty, severance package. Hey! Cheryl! Hey. Hey. Hey. I got that e-mail from Rich yesterday. Hes really good. Walter, thank you. That was... that... that was just a really cool thing to do. I just saw it in Iceland. He loves it, and Im taking him this afternoon. Cool. Hey, I wanted you to know you werent boring me. That day in the park... I-I was... I was thinking about... I hope this doesnt sound weird, but... I was thinking about you. When I was in Greenland... they do karaoke there, and I had to get on this helicopter with a very drunk pilot, and I started to imagine you singing \"Major Tom.\" Anyway, it got me on the helicopter, and it just... got me where I wanted to go. So what happened to you? You sort of fell off the face of the earth there for a little bit. I came by, and I... your husband answered, so I figured I should just go. Phil. He was fixing my refrigerator, and hes not my husband. I guess I imagined that... I thought maybe you got back together. You have a good imagination, but no. Hey, my sister got this role in Grease. Rizzo. Not on Broadway; in some weird church. Do you want to go with me? I made that sound really not good, but... Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. I would love to. Grease in a weird church? You kidding? Rizzo, thats... thats the best part. Yeah, Rizzo. Tough and tender. Yeah. Great. Are you... are you heading uptown? Sure. Yeah? Yeah. I actually always related to Rizzo more. Yeah? Yeah. Was it the, smoking and the teenage sex? No, she was just real, I guess. The last issue, it should be here. It came out this morning. Man, Walter. Should we go buy one of those? Yeah, I was probably gonna... Probably gonna go back later? Yeah, yeah.'"
