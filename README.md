# Smell Of Fear

This study was conducted from Dec 2018 to June 2020 at the University of Auckland under supervision by Dr Joerg Simon Wicker. The paper is currently in submission proceedings. 

In this study we analyse data from cinema audiences to find reliable patterns between the collective experience, i.e. the movie being viewed, and the crowd's breath. This is important because it enables us to make direct links between what a crowd is experiencing and their biological response to the experience. 

To achieve this, we first extracted visual and auditory features from a movie and compared it to the crowd's breath using both regression and pattern mining techniques. Where possible, scene labels from the movies were also added to the datasets. Results show statistically significant relationships between the movie features and the crowd's breath. Additionally, clear changes in the breath data were detected and correlates to the content of a movie.
